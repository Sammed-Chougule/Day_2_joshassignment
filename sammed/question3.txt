Q3. How to combine two commits into one commit? For Example, you have 4 different commits C1, C2, C3, and  C4 and you to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit. 
ans: As given if there are 4 commmits and we want to combine commit C2 nd C3, 
so we will give command 
git rebase --interactive HEAD~4
and then all commit will be opened in editor like
pick C1
pick C2
pick C3
pick C4
and now change it to
pick C1
squash C2
squash C3
pick C4
and save and then again editor will open for give commit message and save.
also do git rebase master or main and then push the code to remote
